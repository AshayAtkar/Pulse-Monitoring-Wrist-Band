# Pulse-Monitoring-Wrist-Band
The Pulse Monitoring Wrist Band, based on ESP32 – C3, merges ancient Ayurvedic NADI PARIKSHAN with modern tech. Worn like a watch on the left hand, it captures Vata, Pitta, and Kapha waveforms in real time. The GUI is used for accurate and insightful evaluations of the obtained waveforms.
# Components required and their description
1) MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor

This is the sensing unit of our gun. It uses Infrared radiations for sensing the temperature. Every object and living being emits IR radiations and by Stefan–Boltzmann law the intensity of this emitted IR radiations is directly proportional to the fourth power of the temperature of the object or living being. Using this it converts the received IR radiations to electrical voltage which is given to Arduino Pro Mini for processing.
